  "body": "## Git in\r\nGin is a [Git](https://git-scm.com)-integrated CMS. It keeps *everything* under version-control, meaning that you can *rewind* to any moment in the existence of your content — or configuration — at will. It's like being able to travel through time.  When using Gin, **you basically have superpowers**. It also works almost entirely offline.\r\n\r\nAwesome. \r\n\r\n## Get started\r\n\r\n### Login\r\nTo start using Gin, you need to go to the CMS [login via GithHub](http://localhost:6170/gin/). If you don't have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one *and* verify your email address. Then you can revisit the Gin [login page](http://localhost:6170/gin/) and login as normal.\r\n\r\n### Create a project\r\nOnce logged in, you'll be able to create a new *project*. Projects contain all your content, as well as all your Gin CMS settings specific to the project (e.g. theme, site URL, etc).\r\n\r\nAll changes in Gin are tracked *locally* within the context of your project. You can then *sync* your project — in other words, back-up your latest changes to the cloud — whenever you want. All you need is an internet connection.\r\n\r\nThis means that **almost all work in Gin can be done offline**. You only require an internet connection for three actions: login (which only has to be done *once*), creating projects, and syncing.\r\n\r\nWork offline. Rewind time. This is the Gin way.\r\n",
