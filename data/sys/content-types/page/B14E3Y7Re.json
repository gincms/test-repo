  "body": "## Git in\r\nGin is a [Git](https://git-scm.com)-integrated CMS. It keeps *everything* under version-control, meaning that you can *rewind* to any moment in the existence of your content — or configuration — at will. It's like being able to travel through time.  When using Gin, **you basically have superpowers**. It also works almost entirely offline.\r\n\r\nAwesome. \r\n\r\n## Get started\r\n\r\n### Run Gin\r\nThe first time you download Gin you'll need to perform some preliminary actions:\r\n\r\n1. Open a terminal\r\n2. `cd` to Gin's directory\r\n3. Run `npm install`\r\n4. Run `npm start`\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, whenever you want to start Gin, perform steps 1, 2 and 4 (i.e. *skip* step 3).\r\n\r\n*NOTE: This process will be simplified in the future to a one-click installation and launch.*\r\n\r\n### Login\r\nTo start using Gin, you need to go to the CMS [login via GithHub](http://localhost:6170/gin/). If you don't have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one *and* verify your email address. Then you can revisit the Gin [login page](http://localhost:6170/gin/) and login as normal.\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n\r\n#### Overview\r\nWhen working on content in Gin, you work within the context of *projects*. Projects are a representation of the underlying Git repository (the technology that makes Gin possible) and contain all your content, as well as all your project-specific Gin CMS settings (e.g. site name, URL, theme &c).\r\n\r\nWhen you first login you'll not have any of your own projects setup, so the *Welcome* project is activated by default. The *Welcome* project is a local and editable version of this website. All of the help pages on this website will be available to you—*offline*.\r\n\r\n#### Create a project\r\nOnce logged in, you'll be given the option to create a new project, but it's a good idea to explore the *Welcome* project to learn what you can do with Gin. Any time other than your first login, when you'd like to create a project:\r\n\r\n1. Go to `Settings`\r\n2. Below the `Project` field, click on `Switch project`\r\n3. Click the `Create a new project` button\r\n\r\n#### Syncing\r\n\r\nAll changes in Gin are tracked *locally* within the context of your project. When you're ready to save your changes to the remote repository, you *sync* the project. *Sync*ing pulls the latest changes from the remote repository, merges your changes into them, and pushes the whole lot back to the remote repository.\r\n\r\nThis means that **almost all work in Gin can be done offline**. You only require an internet connection for three actions: login (which only has to be done *once*), creating projects, and syncing.\r\n\r\nTo sync your project:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you have an internet connection\r\n2. Click `Sync` in the main menu\r\n\r\n\r\n> Work offline. Rewind time. This is the Gin way.\r\n\r\n",
