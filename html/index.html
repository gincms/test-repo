<h1>Welcome to Gin</h1>

<h2>Your content, under control.</h2>

<p>Gin is a Git-integrated CMS. It keeps <em>everything</em> under version-control, meaning that you can <em>rewind</em> to any moment in the existence of your content — or configuration — at will. It&#39;s like being able to travel through time.  When using Gin, <strong>you basically have superpowers</strong>.</p>
<p>Awesome. </p>
<h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>
<h3 id="login">Login</h3>
<p>To start using Gin, you need to go to the CMS <a href="/gin/">login via GithHub</a>. If you&#39;re not signed in and don&#39;t have an account, you&#39;ll be given the opportunity to create one. </p>
<h3 id="create-a-project">Create a project</h3>
<p>Once logged in, you&#39;ll be able to create a new <em>project</em>. Projects contain all your content, as well as all your Gin CMS settings.</p>
<p>All changes in Gin are tracked <em>locally</em> within the context of your project. You can then <em>sync</em> your project — in other words, back-up your latest changes to the cloud — whenever you want. All you need is an internet connection.</p>
<p>This means that <strong>almost all work in Gin can be done offline</strong>. You only require an internet connection for three actions: login (which only has to be done <em>once</em>), creating projects, and syncing.</p>
<p>Work offline. Rewind time. This is the Gin way.</p>
