It can be used for both static pages and blog posts. To create a new <em>page</em>:</p> <ol> <li>Click <code>Content Types</code></li> <li>Click <code>Add page</code> under the <em>Page</em></li> </ol> <p>Alternatively, from the <em>Page list</em>, you can click the <em>Add a page</em> button.</p> <h3 id="page-input-form">Page input form</h3> <p>The input form it pretty straightforward if you&#39;ve used a CMS before, but there are a couple of few things to know, so below are all the fields you&#39;ll find on the edit page, along with a brief explanation of what they&#39;re for and how they work.</p> <h4 id="title">Title</h4> <p><strong>Required:</strong> Put the main title of your content here. A URL is automatically generated which is derived partly from the title field.</p> <h4 id="subtitle">Subtitle</h4> <p><strong>Optional:</strong> You can add a subtitle to your content.</p> <h4 id="slug">Slug</h4> <p><strong>Required:</strong> This is the location of the content you&#39;re editing, <em>relative to the root of your website</em>. When you enter a title, the slug is automatically populated, but you can update it to anything you like (within reason), as long as the <em><a href="#constructed-url">constructed URL</a></em> isn&#39;t already in use. <em>Defaults to the URL-friendly version of the title.</em></p> <h4 id="site-section">Site section</h4> <p><strong>Optional:</strong> This field allows you to choose where on your site the currently edited content will live. The <em>site section</em> is the other factor contributing to the final <em><a href="#constructed-url">constructed URL</a></em>. If this field is left blank, the content will live directly off the root of your website (e.g. www.mysite.com/this-is-my-content/). If you fill in the field, your content will live within the path you&#39;ve added (e.g. www.mysite.com/my-special-section/this-is-my-content/).</p> <h4 id="constructed-url">Constructed URL</h4> <p><strong>Read-only:</strong> This field shows you the URL your content will use once it is published. It is automatically generated and cannot be edited. The only way to change the constructed URL is to change the <a href="#slug">slug</a> and <a href="#site-section">site section</a>, as outlined above. The link just below this field takes you to a preview of the content that is renedered on-the-fly. <em>The link only appears on content that has been saved at least once.</em></p> <h4 id="body">Body</h4> <p><strong>Optional:</strong> Enter you main page/post content in this field. Even though this field is optional, you&#39;ll obviously see an empty page if you don&#39;t fill it with your content. It&#39;s only optional for convenience, in case for some reason you want to add a stub for a post/page but, for whatever reason, will only add the content later.</p> <p>Writing content in Gin is done using Markdown. The editor has various useful features—including some enhancements from Gin—that help to speed up the writing process. There&#39;s a dedicated page to learn more about the <a href="/content/editor/">editor&#39;s features</a>.</p> <h4 id="featured-image">Featured image</h4> <p><strong>Optional:</strong> Although images can be embedded in your content, sometimes (or maybe all the time) you want a main image that will be displayed at the top of the post, in lists, and on social media channels (Twitter, Facebook, &amp;c). If this is the case, add a featured image.</p> <h4 id="summary">Summary</h4> <p><strong>Optional:</strong> In some cases you want a customised summary/overview of your content rather than a truncated version of your first paragraph. This is particularly useful for content lists, as well as for sharing on social media channels, and for improving your metadata for search.</p> <h4 id="blog">Blog</h4> <p><strong>Optional:</strong> Indicates whether or not the content should be treated as a blog post or (if unchecked) a static page. How static pages are displayed will depend on the theme, but the convention is for static pages to not be included general post lists and they won&#39;t display published dates or authors. <em>Defaults to checked—treat as a blog post.</em></p> <h4 id="created">Created</h4> <p><strong>Read-only:</strong> When the content was first created.</p> <h4 id="updated">Updated</h4> <p><strong>Read-only:</strong> When the content was last updated.</p> <h4 id="published">Published</h4> <p><strong>Read-only:</strong> When the content was first published.</p> </section> </article> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> </article> <footer class="footer"> <p class="has-text-centered"> <a href="https://twitter.com/LatnBlack">Twitter</a> </p> <p class="has-text-centered"> <a href="https://latnblack.com">me.com</a> </p> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
