  "body": "<h2 id=\"git-in\">Git in</h2>\n<p><em>Gin</em> is a <a href=\"https://git-scm.com\">Git</a>-integrated CMS. It keeps <em>everything</em> under version-control, meaning that you can <em>rewind</em> to any moment in the existence of your content — or configuration — at will. It&#39;s like being able to travel through time.  When using Gin, <strong>you basically have superpowers</strong>. It also works almost entirely offline.</p>\n<p><em>Awesome</em>. </p>\n<h2 id=\"get-started\">Get started</h2>\n<h3 id=\"run-gin\">Run Gin</h3>\n<p>The first time you download Gin you&#39;ll need to perform some preliminary actions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open a terminal</li>\n<li><code>cd</code> to Gin&#39;s directory</li>\n<li>Run <code>npm install</code></li>\n<li>Run <code>npm start</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once this is done, whenever you want to start Gin, perform steps 1, 2 and 4 (i.e. <em>skip</em> step 3).</p>\n<p><em>NOTE: This process will be simplified in the future to a one-click installation and launch.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"login\">Login</h3>\n<p>To start using Gin, you need to go to the CMS and <a href=\"http://localhost:6170/gin/\">login via GithHub</a>. If you don&#39;t have a GitHub account, you&#39;ll need to create one <em>and</em> verify your email address. Then you can revisit the Gin <a href=\"http://localhost:6170/gin/\">login page</a> and login as normal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"projects\">Projects</h3>\n<h4 id=\"overview\">Overview</h4>\n<p>When working on content in Gin, you work within the context of <em>projects</em>. Projects are a representation of the underlying Git repository (the technology that makes Gin possible) and contain all your content, as well as all your project-specific settings for Gin CMS (e.g. site name, URL, theme &amp;c).</p>\n<p>When you first login you&#39;ll not have any of your own projects setup, so the <em>Welcome</em> project is activated by default. The <em>Welcome</em> project is a local and editable version of this website. All of the help pages on this website will be available to you—<em>offline</em>. However, you will <em>not</em> be able to push changes you make locally to the live Gin CMS site.</p>\n<h4 id=\"create-a-project\">Create a project</h4>\n<p>Once logged in, you&#39;ll be given the option to create a new project, but it&#39;s a good idea to explore the <em>Welcome</em> project to learn what you can do with Gin. Any time other than your first login, when you&#39;d like to create a project:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <code>Settings</code></li>\n<li>Below the <code>Project</code> field, click on <code>Switch project</code></li>\n<li>Click the <code>Create a new project</code> button</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"syncing\">Syncing</h4>\n<p>All changes in Gin are tracked <em>locally</em> within the context of your project. When you&#39;re ready to save your changes to the remote repository, you <em>sync</em> the project. <em>Sync</em>ing pulls the latest changes from the remote repository, merges your changes into them, and pushes the whole lot back to the remote repository.</p>\n<p>This means that <strong>almost all work in Gin can be done offline</strong>. You only require an internet connection for three actions: login (which only has to be done <em>once</em>), creating projects, and syncing.</p>\n<p>To sync your project:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure you have an internet connection</li>\n<li>Click <code>Sync</code> in the main menu</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"next-creating-content\">Next: Creating content</h2>\n",
